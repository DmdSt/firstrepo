Newt. 1st law of motion:
An object that is free of external forces moves at a constant velocity.

Newt. 2nd law of motion:
acceleration = net force/mass
(acc in same direct. as force)
<=>
net force = acc. * mass
F = a*m

weight= downward force due to gravity = 9.8 N/kg  * mass
        =      g    * mass

mass= resistance to acceleration

BALLS

balls fall 42 at same pace, eventhough different weights. explanation: more weight, slower acceleration! 
=> cancellation: 
more weight -> more acceleration = more mass -> more resistance to acceleration.

downyard horizontal motion unaffection by vertical falling motion! 

increasing acc. downwards by ~10mps

RAMPS
Energy (e.g. grav. pot. E.)
Work (change E. in s.th. by moving it)
Work is the same if you lift s.th. vertically 1m high and if you use a slanted ramp until it reaches the height of 1m. (i.e. work same, because energy-increase is same)

support forces exerted perpendicular to surface

Downhill Ramp Force = residual of upward supportforce perp. to surface and downward weight of car. (and will cause car to acceleration downhill)

Newt. 3rd law of motion: 
For every force one object exerts on a second object, the second object exerts the same force on the first.

SEESAWS

Rotation about its own center of mass, its own natural pivot

Seesaw is balanced - no torque due to gravity, because center of gravity is located right at the center of mass as well. 

Newt. 1st law of rotational motion:
Not external torques => constant angular velocity

Newt. 2nd law of rot. motion: 
The angular acc. = net torque / rotational mass

Newt. 3rd law of rot. motion: 
For every applied torque, there is an equal and opposite reaction torque.

WHEELS

Without Wheels => Sliding friction
Adding Wheels eliminates slid. fric.
Wheels only have static friction, doesn't waste as much E.
Even that static fric. can be eliminated by inserting roller bearings / ball bearings betw. hub & axle.

When pulling wagon forward the sidewalk exerts static fric. forces on wheels => produce torques on the wheels => cause angular acc.

in contrast: when you pedal a bicycle, you exert a torque on that powered rear wheel and causing the sidewalk to exert a forward static friction

Wheels have kinetic E. 

BUMPER CARS
Energie, momentum, ang. momentum.
Collision: One doing work on the other -> give other car some of its E.
When 2 collide -> transfer momentan by way of impulse (force*time)
Depending on masses of cars.

Angular momentan, typically transferred during a glancing collision (when one car clips the edge of the second car, second car gets spun around) => angular momentum is transf. into the second car about its center of mass by way of angular impulse!

Energy: You always accelerate in the direction that reduces your energy as quickly as possible, i.e. opposite the local potential energy gradient!
